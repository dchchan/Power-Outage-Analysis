# Power-Outage-Analysis
**By:** David Chhuon-Chan

## Introduction
This project will analyze a dataset of major power outages that happened in the United States in order to understand patterns in outage duration and reporting. In particular, I'm exploring factors related to outage characteristics, test for missingness mechanisms, and build a predictive model for outage duration. 

The goal is to determine which features are helpful for predicting power outage duration.
## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
The dataset contains imformation on major power outages across the U.S., which each row representing a power outage.
The raw data of power outages was cleaned to be easier to work with. Some irrelevant columns were dropped and an 'OUTAGE.DURATION' column was created for easier data handling.
Some relevant columns are:
- **'OUTAGE.DURATION'**: The amount of time of each outage in minutes.
- **'CAUSE.CATEGORY'**: A category describing the cause of the outage.
- **'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED'**: The number of customers affected by the power outage.
- **'CLIMATE.REGION'**: The type of climate region where the power outage happened.
